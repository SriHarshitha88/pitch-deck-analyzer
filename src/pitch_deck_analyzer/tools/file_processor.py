FILE PROCESSING RESULTS:
========================
File Path: {file_path}
File Type: {file_ext}
File Size: {file_size} bytes
Status: Successfully processed

EXTRACTED CONTENT SUMMARY:
=========================
This is a {file_ext} file containing a pitch deck presentation.
The file appears to be properly formatted and readable.

Note: This is a simplified processor. In production, this would:
- Extract text from PDF using PyPDF2 or pdfplumber
- Parse PowerPoint slides using python-pptx
- Read Word documents using python-docx
- Perform OCR on image-based content
- Structure the content for analysis

ANALYSIS READY: The file has been processed and is ready for detailed analysis.
